Steganography is the art and science of writing hiden messages in such a way that no one, 
apart from the sender and intended recipient suspects the existence of the message. 
Example of Steganography we are going to try is 'Hidding a folder behind an image'.
Follow the steps below and you will learn a technique of steganography:

1. Create a folder containing all your secret files in it.
2. Here, the following things are needed :-
	-A folder containing all your secret files: here, 'hide' is the folder .
	-An image to hide the folder: here, image.jpg is the image used. 
3. Create a zip archive of the folder. In linux use the following to zip a folder :
	{% codeblock %} 
	zip -r hide.zip hide
	{% endcodeblock %}
4. Now we will use the linux command 'cat' which is used to for different purposes
	-displaying contents of file.	
	-creating new files.
	-combining copies of files.
5. The 'cat' command will read the image file first, then 'hide.zip' and will concatenate them together, and redirect the output in a file 'final.jpg'.
	{% codeblock %}
	cat image.jpg hide.zip > final.jpg
	{% endcodeblock %}
6. Now, the file 'final.jpg' will contain your secret folder but it would appear as an image to anyone unknown to this technique.
7. To see the hidden folder behind the image:
	{% codeblock %}
	unzip final.jpg
	{% endcodeblock %}
