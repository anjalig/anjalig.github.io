{%blockquote How to make Bootstrap Modals Responsive %}
{%endblockquote %}

Bootstrap Modals are not responsive by default, to make them responsive follow the steps below which includes changing the CSS files in the bootstrap library:

1. In the file bootstrap-responsive.css change/add the following:
	Changed the positioning from absolute to fixed (or really, deleted the positioning variable altogether, as the main CSS file already 		specifies the positioning as fixed).

	Changed the top, left and right positions from pixels to percentages.

	Added a bottom position. This is required to keep the modal-footer from expanding beyond the screen on modals with long blocks of 		text. Because of the fixed positioning, it will never be visible in those instances.

	Added a body height of 60%. This also prevents the modal-footer from being pushed out of view on longer blocks of text, and enables 		overflow-y scrolling.

{% codeblock %}
.modal {
position: fixed;
top: 3%;
right: 3%;
left: 3%;
bottom: 3%;
width: auto;
margin: 0;
}
.modal-body {
height: 60%;
}
{% endcodeblock %}


2. In the file bootstrap.css change/add the following:
	Added -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch to the modal-body.

{% codeblock %}
.modal-body {
max-height: 350px;
padding: 15px;
overflow-y: auto;
-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;
}
{% endcodeblock %}
3. Include the above two files in the 'head' section of the code.

DONE!!!! enjoy Responsive Bootstrap Modals.
